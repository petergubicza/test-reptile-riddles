# Reptile Riddle Test

DDT tests for a quiz app

## Overview

This project focuses on Data-Driven Testing (DDT) using Selenium. It aims to validate the application's functionality with multiple sets of data inputs, ensuring robustness and reliability. Unlike BDD projects, this one does not use Cucumber and is implemented directly with Selenium.
